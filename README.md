## Caipora language

This project is my lab used to practice concepts on compilers, and the idea is to have a very simple language
written in Java. The source code is inspired by the examples given by an introductory course on Compilers
available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjcmNukBom6--0we1zrpoUE2GuRD-Me6W).

Don't expect it to be a real language neither a great example of best practices, although I have this lab as an excuse
to do some refactorings and practice any new stuff that might be made available by new versions of Java.

Again, this is a lab project used by someone interested in Compilers.
